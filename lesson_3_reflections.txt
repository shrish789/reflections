When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If i have some logical changes in my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It makes sure that the control is our hand and we can pull a change whenever we need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork- Cloning a repository from github to github
Clone- Cloning a repo from github to local system or local system to local system.
Branch- It applies on a single repo. I creates multiple branches on a repo.
