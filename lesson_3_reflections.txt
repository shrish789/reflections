When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If i have some logical changes in my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It makes sure that the control is our hand and we can pull a change whenever we need it.
